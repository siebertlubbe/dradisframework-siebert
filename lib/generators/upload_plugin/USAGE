Description:
    Stubs out a new dradis upload plugin. Pass the plugin name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as an argument. The plugin name will be extended with '_upload'
    if this is not part of the plugin name argument.

    This creates a plugin in vendor/plugins including an init.rb and README
    as well as standard lib, task, and test directories.

Note:
    The basic structure is exactly the same as a standard Rails plugin. With a the
    unneeded files and code removed and a bit of customisation to fit the dradis
    upload pugin requirements.

Example:
    `./script/generate upload_plugin Nessus`

    creates a standard upload plugin:
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/README
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/init.rb
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/install.rb
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/uninstall.rb
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/Rakefile
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/lib/nessus_upload.rb
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/spec/spec_helper.rb
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/spec/nessus_upload_spec.rb
        vendor/plugins/nessus_upload/tasks/nessus_upload_tasks.rake
