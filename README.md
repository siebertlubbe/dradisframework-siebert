Welcome to Dradis
=================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradisframework.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradisframework)

Dradis is an open source framework to enable effective information sharing, 
specially during security assessments.

Our goals:

* Share the information effectively.
* Easy to use, easy to be adopted. Otherwise it would present little benefit over other systems.
* Flexible: with a powerful and simple extensions interface. 
* Small and portable. You should be able to use it while on site (no outside connectivity). It should be OS independent (no two testers use the same OS).

Some of the features:

* Platform independent
* Easy report generation: in Word, HTML, etc.
* Markup support for the notes: styles, images, links, etc. 
* Integration with existing systems and tools:
  * [Burp Scanner](http://portswigger.net/burp/scanner.html)
  * [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/)
  * [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/products/nessus)
  * [NeXpose](http://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose-community-edition.jsp)
  * [Nikto](http://cirt.net/nikto2)
  * [Nmap](http://nmap.org)
  * [OpenVAS](http://www.openvas.org/)
  * [OSVDB](http://osvdb.org)
  * [Retina](http://www.eeye.com/products/retina/retina-network-scanner)
  * [SureCheck](http://www.wildcroftsecurity.com/)
  * [VulnDB](http://vulndbhq.com)
  * [w3af](http://w3af.sourceforge.net/)
  * [wXf](https://github.com/WebExploitationFramework/wXf)
  * [Zed Attack Proxy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project)


Getting started (git release, recommended)
------------------------------------------

On Debian-based operating systems (Ubuntu, BackTrack, etc.) use this script:

    $ bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/install.sh)

The script:
  1. Checks for system-level dependencies (git, openssl, etc.)
  2. Installs [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/) and Ruby 1.9.3. It detects and reuses your existing RVM too.
  3. Downloads and prepares the git repo with Dradis code

[View install.sh source](https://github.com/dradis/meta/blob/master/install.sh)

If you want to manually clone the repo:

    $ mkdir dradis-git
    $ cd dradis-git/
    $ git clone https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework.git server

Then download the reset and start scripts to your dradis-git/ folder:

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/reset.sh
    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/start.sh
    $ chmod +x *.sh
    $ ./reset.sh

Once the environment is ready, you can start the server with:

    $ ./start.sh

And browse to https://localhost:3004 to start using Dradis.

If you would like to make Dradis accessible to other people on the network:

    $ ./start.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -p 443

The `-b` option defines Dradis' bind address and the `-p` option can be used to change the port.


Getting started (stable release)
--------------------------------

In http://dradisframework.org/downloads.html you will find a Windows installer
and .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 packages.

Uncompress, verify and prepare the environment:

    $ tar xvvjf dradis-vX.Y.Z.tar.bz2
    $ cd dradis-vX.Y/
    $ ./verify.sh
      # follow instructions / install dependencies
    $ ./reset.sh

Once the environment is ready, you can start the server with:

    $ ./start.sh

And browse to https://localhost:3004 to start using Dradis. If you need to bind
to a different address (so others can connect to your instance) or another port
number, you can use the -b and -p switches respectively:

    $ ./start.sh -b 10.0.0.123 -p 443
