# This is the template for the host node
# This ERB template is used by the nessus importer for the initial note for every host
# and contains details about the scanned system 
# 
# You can access the details of the current host by using the "host" object which has the following 
# properties:
#
# host.name                 The name given at scan time, usually an IP address
# host.ip                   The ip address of the host
# host.fqdn                 The full qualified domain name of the host
# host.operating_system     The OS of the system if detected
# host.mac_address          The mac address if the scanned system was on the same subnet
# host.netbios_name         The netbios name of the system
#
# host.scan_start_time      The date/time the scan started
# host.scan_stop_time       The date/time the scan ended
#
# Note that, depending on the scan/system not all properties must contain values
# In this case the property returns nil
#
# If you want to retrieve the results of the host in this template you can do this by
# access host.report_items
#
# The template engine doesn't add new lines for lines that contain ruby code for the ERB template 
# Keep that in mind when you create your template
